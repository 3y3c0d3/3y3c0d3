Hello, my name is Ryan. I currently work as a data analyst, and I have a strong ambition to transition into a machine learning engineering role in the future. My passion lies in solving real-world problems through the use of data and modern analytical techniques. To this end, I am constantly engaged in developing practical projects that leverage the power of Python programming, structured query language (SQL), and advanced data visualization platforms such as Tableau. By building these projects, I aim to sharpen my technical skills and apply my theoretical knowledge to authentic scenarios faced by businesses and organizations.

My core areas of expertise include thorough data analysis, where I examine raw data to extract meaningful patterns and actionable insights. Additionally, I am building proficiency in various machine learning methods, enabling me to create predictive models and automated solutions. I am also skilled at designing and presenting impactful data visualizations, which help in effectively communicating complex findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

At this stage in my career, I am actively seeking entry-level opportunities in the domains of data analytics and artificial intelligence. I am eager to join innovative teams where I can further develop my abilities, contribute to significant projects, and learn from experienced professionals in the field of data science and AI.
